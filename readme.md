The principle of this application is to create a weather map based on GoogleMaps background and on Previmeteo weather API ( http://api.previmeteo.com )

What do you need :

- webserver with PHP5 with GD and fopen enabled for URL ( http://php.net/manual/en/function.file.php )
- an API key from Previmeteo (free for personal projects)

That's all falks !
